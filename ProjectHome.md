Bump2Panes is a small application that adds Window Management features to the Bumptop UI. It is built using their built in legacy widget support.

B2P for short works by taking a snapshot of each window and changing the widget.json file whenever a window is minimized.
This allows Bumptop to read the file as a launch-able widget depicting the minimized window.
